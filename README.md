###🎮 My Favriote Games
I mostly like to play Minecraft, with mods, the mods I play are ![Minecraft Transit Railway](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-transit-railway) and ![CC-Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked)
I like to also code computer programs with the CC-Tweaked mod too. Other than Minecraft, I have played ![Roblox](https://roblox.com), I have not been very intrusted in it, I mostly only play it for ideas and
I also make some studio games that I don't publish.
